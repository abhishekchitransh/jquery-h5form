This plugin gives all browsers the HTML5 form validation such as Opera. *1

 * The controls of date will be extended in Chrome and Safari.

 * The controls of date and number will be extended in FireFox.

 * In addtiion to them in IE, the attribute of requied, spaceHolder and autoFocus
   and the validation of url, email and pattern will be all enabled.
   The error message will be balloon like other modern browsers.

 * As a result will not be anything in the Opera.

These features are judged by whether or not the  input element has there object.
For future versions of browsers or for unknown browsers, they will be able to support
nearly maintenance-free. *2


And this will also fix all of the bug in IE on submit, and will allow you to use
button elements.

 * When you click the button element of submit, IE does not send the value of the
   clicked button but send the context of all button.

 * When you press Enter in input element of text, IE does not send the value of the
   first button element of submit.

 * When you press Enter in input element of text, IE does not send the value of the
   first input element of submit if there is only one input element of text.

 * The default type of button element in IE is button rather than submit.


Note
 *1 The specification of the global date and time (datetime) has been adopted the W3C
    draft. Therefore, it's user interface is unlike the Opera.

 *2 Whether there is a calendar in the interface of date are determined by the
    type of browser. This part will need to be changed when the version-up of browsers.
