This plugin gives all browsers the HTML5 forms like the Opera.

Whether these enhancements are determined in the presence or absence of the object in a input element.
For the other versions of browsers, it will be able to support nearly maintenance-free ... maybe.

And this will also fix several bugs of the Internet Explorer on submit, and will allow you to use the button element.



__More information about the support of each browser, [please see here...](http://www.rapidexp.com/h5form)__

And if you wish, you can get a smaller size javascript by removing unnecessary features.
