This plugin gives all browsers the HTML5 form validation such as Opera. *1

 * The controls of date will be extended in Chrome and Safari.

 * The controls of date and number will be extended in FireFox.

 * In addtiion to them in IE, the attribute of required, spaceHolder, autoFocus
   and novalidate and the validation of url, email and pattern will be all enabled.
   The error message will be balloon like other modern browsers.

 * As a result will not be anything in the Opera.

These features are judged by whether or not the input element has there object.
For future versions of browsers or for unknown browsers, they will be able to
support nearly maintenance-free. *2


And this will also fix all of the bug in IE on submit, and will allow you to use
button elements.

 * When you click the button element of submit, IE does not send the value of the
   clicked button but send the context of all button.

 * When you press Enter in input element of text, IE does not send the value of the
   first button element of submit.

 * When you press Enter in input element of text, IE does not send the value of the
   first input element of submit if there is only one input element of text.

 * The default type of button element in IE is button rather than submit.


Note
 *1 The specification of the global date and time (datetime) has been adopted the
    W3C draft. Therefore, it's user interface is unlike the Opera.

 *2 Whether there is a calendar in the interface of date are determined by the type
    of browser. This part will need to be changed when the version-up of browsers.

  <script type="text/javascript" src="jquery.h5form-x.x.min.js"></script>

  <script type="text/javascript">
  $(function() {
    $('form').h5form();
  });
  </script>


Note: IE6/7 will cause an error to use jQuery 1.7.

to the option "dinamicHtml".


  $('form').h5form({ dinamicHtml: '[name="password"]' });

additional settings.



Thanks
============================

This plugin was derived from jquery.html5form-1.5.js.
But the first concept of modification was already different from the original
direction. And I had to make significant changes to policy design in version 2.
Therefore I determined that the project become apparent to another code, I was
allowed to change to a single copyright in the header from version 2.
Some Variable names and structure may still have left a remnant of html5form.
